Hit and Run\r\n\I noticed a merging sign several feet away on the highway.\r\n\Since the traffic was horrible, I slowly tried to maneuver my car.\r\n\A large industrial truck tried to turn on the same lane.\r\n\We ended up colliding.\r\n\Without a hesitation, he still decided to drive forwards and left me.\r\n\
