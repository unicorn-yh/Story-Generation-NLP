Nanny and Grandpa\r\n\Last week we visited our 2 year old granddaughter in NYC.\r\n\We live in Boston and do not see her much.\r\n\Our daughter told the girl her grandparents were coming.\r\n\Waiting for us, she was at the window, singing Nanny and Grandpa.\r\n\Our daughter sent us the video, moving us to tears.\r\n\
