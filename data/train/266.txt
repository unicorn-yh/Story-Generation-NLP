Long Day\r\n\I visited the hospital this morning.\r\n\As soon as I was registered, I took the elevator to the fourth floor.\r\n\The nurse took my vitals and started my treatment.\r\n\Before leaving, my child life specialist told me about a special event.\r\n\I ended up leaving 2 hours later after attending the event.\r\n\
