Car\r\n\I used to wash my car every weekend.\r\n\Unfortunately, little incidents can cause us to change our habits.\r\n\I had a little accident and caused a small dent in my car one day.\r\n\This upset me greatly as I loved my car very much.\r\n\In fact, it upset me so much that I stopped washing my car.\r\n\
