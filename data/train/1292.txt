My Granddaughter's Graduation\r\n\I took a trip to New York for my granddaughter's graduation.\r\n\I was happy to drive a long way for the event.\r\n\I watched with pride as she received her diploma.\r\n\After the ceremony, we took a lot of pictures.\r\n\Then we went out to a restaurant to celebrate.\r\n\
