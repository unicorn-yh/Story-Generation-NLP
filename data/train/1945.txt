Free Lunch\r\n\On June 21, our building had to shut off water for repairs.\r\n\There are 250 units in the building, and people were upset.\r\n\The management opened up the clubroom and offered free lunch.\r\n\They had sandwiches, chips, soda, and cookies.\r\n\The party quieted the complaints until service was restored later.\r\n\
