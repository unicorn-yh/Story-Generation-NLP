Up Close\r\n\My grandparents and I were going for a walk.\r\n\We were walking near some pine trees and turned a corner.\r\n\Suddenly, right in front of us, was a huge moose.\r\n\It was so close that it scared us, but they told me not to run.\r\n\We all stood still and soon the moose walked away without harm.\r\n\
