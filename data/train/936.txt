New Lights\r\n\On July 11th, the management sent electricians into our apartment.\r\n\They replaced the hall ceiling lights with led bulbs.\r\n\The procedure took only ten minutes.\r\n\The hallway was much lighter, and not as pleasant.\r\n\We did not argue with the energy efficiency approach, however.\r\n\
