A Dance Move Surprise\r\n\My friend Jake and I went to San Francisco to party.\r\n\We met a great dancer who knew how to do the Worm.\r\n\I wanted to impress him, so I dropped down to try the move.\r\n\I pulled it off, but I felt something dripping off of my chin.\r\n\When I stood up, I realized I had busted my chin open doing the Worm.\r\n\
