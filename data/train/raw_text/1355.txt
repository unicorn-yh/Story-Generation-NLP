A fun day at the libraryOne day we decided to upgrade our software at the library.Our vendor told us he'd start at 9:15.He started MUCH later, throwing our schedule into chaos.Then, the vendor make unannounced changes as well,breaking many parts!Hours later than scheduled, all was restored to working order.
