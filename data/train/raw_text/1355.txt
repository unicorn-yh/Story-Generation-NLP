A fun day at the library\r\n\One day we decided to upgrade our software at the library.\r\n\Our vendor told us he'd start at 9:15.\r\n\He started MUCH later, throwing our schedule into chaos.\r\n\Then, the vendor make unannounced changes as well,breaking many parts!\r\n\Hours later than scheduled, all was restored to working order.\r\n\
