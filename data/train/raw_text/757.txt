Almost Arrested At ChipotleMy girlfriend and I were hungry one day, so I used Chipotle's app.Not thinking anything of it, I used the saved credit card on file.When I went to pick up the food, the employees stared at me weirdly.One asked me to wait while she called the police.Turns out I had used the credit card my girlfriend reported stolen.
