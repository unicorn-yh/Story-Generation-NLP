Almost Arrested At Chipotle\r\n\My girlfriend and I were hungry one day, so I used Chipotle's app.\r\n\Not thinking anything of it, I used the saved credit card on file.\r\n\When I went to pick up the food, the employees stared at me weirdly.\r\n\One asked me to wait while she called the police.\r\n\Turns out I had used the credit card my girlfriend reported stolen.\r\n\
