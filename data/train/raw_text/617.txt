Movies\r\n\I decided that I wanted to see one new movie each week.\r\n\I went to the movies at first, but the tickets were expensive!\r\n\I tried to rent a DVD, but nothing I wanted to see was available.\r\n\I went home and found a movie streaming service instead.\r\n\Now, I see a new movie every day!\r\n\
