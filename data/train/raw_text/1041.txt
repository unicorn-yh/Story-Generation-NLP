Zombie DuskAs a child, I always feared the monsters under my bed.Now my children fear those same monsters under their own beds.But today I solved the problem by destroying the monsters' homes.I installed a chest of drawers under each bed.No one is afraid of a monster that lives in an underwear drawer.
