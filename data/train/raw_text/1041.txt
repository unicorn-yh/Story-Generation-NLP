Zombie Dusk\r\n\As a child, I always feared the monsters under my bed.\r\n\Now my children fear those same monsters under their own beds.\r\n\But today I solved the problem by destroying the monsters' homes.\r\n\I installed a chest of drawers under each bed.\r\n\No one is afraid of a monster that lives in an underwear drawer.\r\n\
