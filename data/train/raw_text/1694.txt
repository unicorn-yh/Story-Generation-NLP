I Won a Plant and My Cat Ate the Whole ThingI won a houseplant at an open house for a veterinary clinic.I really liked this plant because I appreciated winning a prize.Ironically, my cat thought it was very tasty and kept chewing on it.The plant eventually was completely eaten, and my cat and I felt sad.I bought another one to replace it, and we were both happy once more.
