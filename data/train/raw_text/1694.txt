I Won a Plant and My Cat Ate the Whole Thing\r\n\I won a houseplant at an open house for a veterinary clinic.\r\n\I really liked this plant because I appreciated winning a prize.\r\n\Ironically, my cat thought it was very tasty and kept chewing on it.\r\n\The plant eventually was completely eaten, and my cat and I felt sad.\r\n\I bought another one to replace it, and we were both happy once more.\r\n\
