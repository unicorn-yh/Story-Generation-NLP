Chain of bad LuckSince the bus came late, I ended up late to my class.Since my professor was in a bad mood, he yelled at me.He also gave me a zero grade for today's assignments.Later on that day, I found out that I dropped out of my classes.Financial aid told me that there was nothing that I can do.
