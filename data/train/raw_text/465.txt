Symphonic\r\n\I went to see a performance of the local symphony.\r\n\All their instruments were out of tune and their timing was off.\r\n\I cringed all the way through two of their songs.\r\n\Just as I prepared to depart, I read the performance notes.\r\n\This symphony was composed of the local deaf and blind musicians.\r\n\
