Teaching my friends to sing\r\n\A few weeks ago I had to teach all my friends how to sing a song.\r\n\It was a song about how much fun we had at camp this year.\r\n\All my friends are terrible singers though.\r\n\We worked on the song all week.\r\n\At the end of the week, my friends still were not good singers.\r\n\
