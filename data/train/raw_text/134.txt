Ice Cream Day\r\n\Our apartment building hosted an ice cream party in June.\r\n\They hired an ice cream truck to give out free ice cream.\r\n\The truck was parked in the driveway, which was blocked off to traffic.\r\n\We had ice cream and watched a lot of young children eat.\r\n\The party lasted two hours, and we had a lot of fun.\r\n\
