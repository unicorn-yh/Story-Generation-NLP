Jacob's New Business Venture\r\n\Jacob has always loved serving people food.\r\n\He loved when his parents hosted parties growing up.\r\n\Jacob's passion led him to open a bistro downtown.\r\n\He didn't do a good job in picking a chef to hire.\r\n\Now no one wants to eat there because the food isn't very good.\r\n\
