My Pretty PonyIn 1983, I received a My Little Pony for Christmas.I refused to open or play with any of my other gifts.My family thought it was funny, because I told them I didn't want them.I truly only wanted the large plastic horse.I slept with it that night, and hit my brother in my sleep with it.
