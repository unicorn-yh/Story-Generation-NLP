A Bad Day at Work\r\n\Clay had a rough day today.\r\n\He got a flat tire on the way to work, so he was very late.\r\n\At work, he had to fix five jobs that others had done incorrectly.\r\n\While working on these jobs, he broke three of his tools!\r\n\Clay was happy to go home that day, and glad it was Friday!\r\n\
