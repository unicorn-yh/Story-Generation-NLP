Borderlands\r\n\All of the people in my house like the game Borderlands.\r\n\Unfortunately we only had two computers and there were three of us.\r\n\We spent a while occasionally tinkering with spare parts.\r\n\Eventually we combined two broken PCs to make one working one.\r\n\We all really love playing Borderlands together now.\r\n\
