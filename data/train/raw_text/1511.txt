Water Park\r\n\It was a hot day, so the family drove to the water park.\r\n\They applied their sunscreen and set off to enjoy the slides.\r\n\After some time, they took a break in the lazy river.\r\n\After hearing the wave signal, they got in the wave pool for a swim.\r\n\At the end of the day, they showered and prepared to head home.\r\n\
