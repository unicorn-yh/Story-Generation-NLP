Too proud for fansGreg was such a good baseball player, he had many fans.But because he was very proud, he didn't treat his fans well.He never answered his fan mail and laughed at those who praised him.After a few month, he realized he had a lot less fans than before.He changed his behavior and finally was loved again.
