A Contact With an Old AcquaintanceA girl I used to babysit for contacted me through social media.She's no longer a little girl, but is in her 30s.She told me she loves the Beatles because I often played their music.I don't even remember this, and it touched my heart that she said so.It's amazing we can have an influence through the little things we do.
