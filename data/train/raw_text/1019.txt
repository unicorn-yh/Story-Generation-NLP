A Contact With an Old Acquaintance\r\n\A girl I used to babysit for contacted me through social media.\r\n\She's no longer a little girl, but is in her 30s.\r\n\She told me she loves the Beatles because I often played their music.\r\n\I don't even remember this, and it touched my heart that she said so.\r\n\It's amazing we can have an influence through the little things we do.\r\n\
