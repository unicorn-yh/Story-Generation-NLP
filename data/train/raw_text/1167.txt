Piano\r\n\Tom, a pianist, moved in next door to me.\r\n\I thought I would get the chance to hear beautiful music all day long.\r\n\Unfortunately, Tom only practiced the discordant parts.\r\n\Instead of beautiful music, I heard only jarring noises.\r\n\Every time he plays the piano, I grit my teeth.\r\n\
