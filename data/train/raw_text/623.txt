Free Donut Day\r\n\June 3rd was Free Donut Day this year.\r\n\Dunkin Donuts gave out free donuts with the purchase of a coffee.\r\n\My wife picked me up after work and we headed to our local shop.\r\n\I had a Boston cream donut, and she had a chocolate one.\r\n\We both enjoyed our free donuts, despite the calories.\r\n\
