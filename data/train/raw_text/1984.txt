The Appalachians\r\n\The mountains were a scene of unimaginable beauty.\r\n\In fall everything the light touched shone with colors of the leaves.\r\n\Riding down the road was like taking a trip into a painting.\r\n\The leaves of the trees combined into a collage of loveliness.\r\n\Every year the same beauty returned.\r\n\
