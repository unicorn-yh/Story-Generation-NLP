Close but Not CloseI stole the ball from my opponent and approached my side of the court.I tried to run fast in order to stay ahead of the opposing team.When I reached the free throw line, I attempted to do a slam dunk.However, my head landed on the side of the backboard.I instantly fell on my back and the medics had to take care of me.
