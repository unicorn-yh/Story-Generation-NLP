Lost Sight\r\n\The bus was coming towards my stop.\r\n\Since he didn't notice me in the corner of the area, he didn't stop.\r\n\He continued to drive and passed me.\r\n\I tried running towards the bus but he wasn't paying attention.\r\n\Afterwards, I decided to go home and take the entire day off.\r\n\
