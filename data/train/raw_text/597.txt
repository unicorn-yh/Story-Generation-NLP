Embarrassing Moment\r\n\My teacher was discussing the new chapter in Physics.\r\n\While he was talking, I was navigating through my laptop.\r\n\As soon as I visited a new webpage, a sound went off.\r\n\The entire class became quiet and looked at me.\r\n\I quickly turned off my computer and ended up making it fall.\r\n\
