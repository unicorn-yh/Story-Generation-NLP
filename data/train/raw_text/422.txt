Moving Out\r\n\I had lived with my best friend for four years.\r\n\When I met my fiancee I knew we were going start a life.\r\n\When I asked her to move in with me she said yes.\r\n\I couldn't figure out how to tell my best friend though.\r\n\So I just moved out while he was working and left a note.\r\n\
