CurtainsI wanted some new curtains for my house.Since curtains are expensive, I decided to sew them myself.I picked out some soft, pink fabric that complimented my walls well.After sewing the curtains, I put them up with some help from a friend.I did such a good job that my friend asked me where I had bought them.
