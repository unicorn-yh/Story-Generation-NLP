Curtains\r\n\I wanted some new curtains for my house.\r\n\Since curtains are expensive, I decided to sew them myself.\r\n\I picked out some soft, pink fabric that complimented my walls well.\r\n\After sewing the curtains, I put them up with some help from a friend.\r\n\I did such a good job that my friend asked me where I had bought them.\r\n\
