Betting On The CowboysI had a feeling the Dallas Cowboys would win the Super Bowl.I went to Las Vegas so I could bet on them having a winning season.Everyone laughed and told me I was crazy.I didn't see the news that day and I guess they all did.Tony Romo, the quarterback, broke his neck and is out for the season.
