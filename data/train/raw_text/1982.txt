Betting On The Cowboys\r\n\I had a feeling the Dallas Cowboys would win the Super Bowl.\r\n\I went to Las Vegas so I could bet on them having a winning season.\r\n\Everyone laughed and told me I was crazy.\r\n\I didn't see the news that day and I guess they all did.\r\n\Tony Romo, the quarterback, broke his neck and is out for the season.\r\n\
