Bus Troubles\r\n\In Mexico, I got to visit 1 of the 7 wonders, Chichen Itza.\r\n\My classmates and I took a big bus to get there.\r\n\On our way back to the city, the bus broke down.\r\n\We sat in the sweltering Mexican heat for hours waiting for a new bus.\r\n\Finally, the new bus came to take us back to the city.\r\n\
