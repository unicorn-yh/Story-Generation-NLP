The Clubhouse\r\n\My neighbor Andy came over to play.\r\n\We opened the door that went under the house.\r\n\We crawled under the house, where we had just enough room to sit up.\r\n\We called it our clubhouse, and met there every day after school.\r\n\There is still a notebook for role call under there somewhere.\r\n\
