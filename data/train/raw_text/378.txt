Worry about MexicoI was very worried about studying abroad in Mexico.I spoke very good Spanish, but I wasn't sure if it would be enough.I was nervous the entire plane ride to Mexico City.When I got there, my host family greeted me with open arms.They told me not to worry because I spoke great Spanish.
