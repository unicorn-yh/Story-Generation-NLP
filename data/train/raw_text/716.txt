Pickled\r\n\My cousin took us to a specialty pickle maker.\r\n\When we got there, there was a booth with lots of jars on the table.\r\n\We talked to the man who makes the pickles, and he is a former lawyer.\r\n\He said he retired just to sell pickles, because they were so popular.\r\n\We left with 10 jars with different flavors.\r\n\
