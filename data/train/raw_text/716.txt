PickledMy cousin took us to a specialty pickle maker.When we got there, there was a booth with lots of jars on the table.We talked to the man who makes the pickles, and he is a former lawyer.He said he retired just to sell pickles, because they were so popular.We left with 10 jars with different flavors.
