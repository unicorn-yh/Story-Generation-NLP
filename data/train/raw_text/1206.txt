Car Repair\r\n\My family stayed in a hotel for a week while our car was repaired.\r\n\All of our clothes and belongings were in the car in the shop.\r\n\We had to buy new clothes for the week.\r\n\We had to eat out for every meal.\r\n\By the time our transmission was fixed, we had no money left.\r\n\
