Concert with DadWhen I was 14, my favorite band came to town for a concert.My dad bought tickets under the condition that he could chaperone.At the concert, he stayed in the balcony while I was in the mosh pit.Afterwards, he said he hated the music.A week later, I found him listening to the band's music.
