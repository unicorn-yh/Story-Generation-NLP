Long Island\r\n\Last week we went to dinner in Baldwin, Long Island.\r\n\We were visiting from Boston, and our friend had us over.\r\n\She cooked Dominican food, such as rice and beans and pork shoulder.\r\n\We had flan for dessert.\r\n\We stayed for hours, and returned to our hotel very stuffed.\r\n\
