Fiddler's Fancy\r\n\My neighbor asked me to attend a concert with her.\r\n\It was a group of old-time fiddlers playing for a festival.\r\n\My mother's family used to sit and sing mountain music every night.\r\n\I wasn't sure I would like the fiddlers' music.\r\n\In fact, I loved it because I recognized some of the tunes!\r\n\
