The Grahams\r\n\The Grahams are one of my favorite families.\r\n\They go to Florida every summer to visit their elderly family members.\r\n\The grandma loves to play scrabble when they get there, late at night.\r\n\She always bakes a lemon meringue pie for them.\r\n\They really enjoy their long visits during the summer.\r\n\
