Charlie's Broken Leg\r\n\When I found Charlie Horse under my bed, his leg was messed up.\r\n\Upon closer look, the stuffing was starting to come out.\r\n\The seams had ruptured.\r\n\When I looked at my dog, he was also under the bed.\r\n\He looked very guilty, leading me to believe he caused the damage.\r\n\
