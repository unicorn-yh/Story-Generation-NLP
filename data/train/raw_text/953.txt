Going out for Sushi.\r\n\Today I had a dinner date with my husband.\r\n\We decided to try out a new Sushi place near our home.\r\n\It was very crowded but we had a reservation.\r\n\We ordered spicy tuna rolls and eel and enjoyed some time alone.\r\n\The food great, we both agreed we would go back again.\r\n\
