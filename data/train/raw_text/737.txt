The fall\r\n\I was visiting my hometown for the first time in twenty years.\r\n\It was fall and the trees were all turning beautiful colors.\r\n\I was so  taken by the sight I filled my camera with photos of trees.\r\n\I had fall fever instead of spring fever.\r\n\Upon returning home I shared all my fall photos with family.\r\n\
