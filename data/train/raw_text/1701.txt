It's hard to escape the sunThis week, there was a heat wave.I was sitting next to a window in direct sunlight so I got overheated.To cool off, I moved to a room on the other side of the house.Unfortunately, I forgot that the sun moves.All too soon, the sun was heating up the room I'd moved to instead.
