Nasty Occurrence.Jen searched for her drinking cup in the house.It was tough for her to find it since most of the cups looked the same.She picked up one of them and started to drink from it.Unfortunately, she started to choke since there were nails in the cup.I had to help her cough it out by performing the Heimlich maneuver.
