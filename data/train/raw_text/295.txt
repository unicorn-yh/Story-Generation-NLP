WaterDetermined to drink more water, I carried a water bottle everywhere.One thing that I have omitted is making the sure the bottle is closed.One time, I put the bottle of water in my bag with the cap off.I soon discovered the water had soaked my books completely.Fortunately, my books were still readable after that event.
