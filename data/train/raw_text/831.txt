Love of fishesEvery year, the Johnson family goes fishing.This year, because of the bad weather, they can't go.They decide instead to go to the aquarium and see living fishes.They enjoy their trip so much, they decide to make it a new tradition.Now they go to the aquarium instead of going fishing every year.
