Scary MoviesMy friend Jim invited me to see a scary movie the other day.I don't like scary movies at all, but I told him I would go anyways.We went to the theater and bought popcorn and drinks.When the movie started I was nervous that it would be too scary.Fortunately, the movie wasn't that scary and we had a good time.
