Grandma Knows Best\r\n\I was spending a few days at my grandparents house.\r\n\Their house was heated by a wooden stove.\r\n\My grandma told me never to touch it, even if it did not look hot.\r\n\I put my hand on the stove when she wasn't looking.\r\n\I burned my hand and received little sympathy from my grandma.\r\n\
