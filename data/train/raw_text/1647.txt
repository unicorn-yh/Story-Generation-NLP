My Robotic Cat\r\n\I have a remote control cat named Fluffy.\r\n\I gave her the name as a source of irony.\r\n\I recieved her in 2005 as a gift from my son, who is autistic.\r\n\He was overjoyed to finally purchase something for someone else.\r\n\It made him feel like a big boy, and made me feel very happy as a mom.\r\n\
