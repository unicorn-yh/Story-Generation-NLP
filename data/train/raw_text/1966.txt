For the love of musicJuliana really wanted to learn how to play the piano.As she didn't have a piano at home, she practiced at a friend's house.When her parents saw how serious she was, they bought her a piano.Juliana was ecstatic and practiced a lot every day.She now plays very well and people enjoy her music very much.
