Death of a Maple\r\n\My parents planted a maple tree on the day that I was born.\r\n\Every time they saw the tree growing taller, they thought of me.\r\n\By the time I left for college, the tree was taller than their house.\r\n\But the maple tree was rotted from disease.\r\n\My parents cried as they cut their beloved tree down.\r\n\
