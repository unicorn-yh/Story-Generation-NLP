A Dance Move SurpriseMy friend Jake and I went to San Francisco to party.We met a great dancer who knew how to do the Worm.I wanted to impress him, so I dropped down to try the move.I pulled it off, but I felt something dripping off of my chin.When I stood up, I realized I had busted my chin open doing the Worm.
