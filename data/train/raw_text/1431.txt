Sea Creature ExperienceWhen visiting Hawaii, my husband asked me to snorkel with a manta ray.I was a little scared, especially since the dive was at night!We were all stretched out in the water, holding onto the float.Our faces were in the water and bright lights were on.Suddenly, a huge and graceful manta swam within inches of my face!
