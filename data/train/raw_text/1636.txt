Single Again\r\n\I flew to Kansas to meet my fiance.\r\n\When I got off the plane, he was not at the airport waiting for me.\r\n\I called his cell phone and he told me he was with his girlfriend.\r\n\I told him that I'm going to keep the engagement ring.\r\n\I bought a ticket home using his credit card.\r\n\
