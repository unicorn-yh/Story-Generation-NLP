Lucky Penny\r\n\Brett did not believe in luck.\r\n\While he was walking home one day a shiny penny caught his eye.\r\n\He bent over to pick it up because he did believe in money.\r\n\Bent over, a car crashed into a tree right where he should have been.\r\n\The penny has not left his jeans since, he now believes in luck.\r\n\
