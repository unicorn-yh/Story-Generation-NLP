I Think It's A CarpetBob looked through some pictures of a home he was interested in.One of them showed some serious stains on the carpet.Bob then realized he wasn't even sure it was a carpet.He thought it could very well be a roof leak instead.Bob decided to pass on that house and moved on to the next one.
