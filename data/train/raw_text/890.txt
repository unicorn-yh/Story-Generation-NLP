Sunday Drive\r\n\I went for a fun drive on Sunday.\r\n\I knew the market square was always crowded, then.\r\n\I floored my car through the pedestrians, knocking them all down.\r\n\My car stalled out from all the blood and brain matter in the engine.\r\n\It was very awkward getting out of my car in the gathering crowd.\r\n\
