Hall of Science\r\n\Last week we visited our two year old granddaughter in New York.\r\n\We went to the Hall of Science in Queens.\r\n\Our granddaughter had a lot of fun chasing the bubbles in one room.\r\n\She also loved the Connected Worlds Hall.\r\n\We bought her a gift at the shop, thus making her happy as we left.\r\n\
