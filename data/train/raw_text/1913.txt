I Might Lose My JobI recently started work at a medium-sized housing company.I was instructed to send individual emails to tenants.Wanting to speed things up, I sent a single email to all 450 tenants.Apparently this is a severe violation of federal policy.I could be in a lot of trouble if someone reports me.
