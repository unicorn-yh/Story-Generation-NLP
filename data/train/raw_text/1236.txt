Max abd Cassie\r\n\Max and Cassie were fun loving grey tabby cats.\r\n\They were brother and sister, found abandoned on the side of the road.\r\n\They spent their first weeks underweight, fed by kitten formula.\r\n\I used a bottle filled with the formula and held them while they ate.\r\n\They thought I was their mommy from that day on.\r\n\
