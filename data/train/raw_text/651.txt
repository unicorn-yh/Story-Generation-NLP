Max Has a Very Good Dog\r\n\Max was at work when he realized he had left the yard gate open.\r\n\Because the dog has a special door to go outside, this was a problem.\r\n\Max called a neighbor to go see whether the dog was loose.\r\n\The gate was open, but the dog was relaxing under a tree.\r\n\Max was relieved that he has such a well-behaved dog.\r\n\
