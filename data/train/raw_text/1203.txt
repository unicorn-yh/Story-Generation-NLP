Way Too Meta\r\n\My friend ask me to tell him a story.\r\n\I struggled to come up with something to tell him.\r\n\He glared at me impatiently, like I was wasting his time.\r\n\I told him that wasn't fair because he'd come to me for one.\r\n\As he stomped off, I thought I should reconsider our friendship.\r\n\
