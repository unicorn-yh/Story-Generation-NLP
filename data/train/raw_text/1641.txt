Foot\r\n\Let me tell you about the time I broke my foot.\r\n\It happened at a hotel, during a business trip.\r\n\There was a power outage on the day I checked out of the hotel.\r\n\As I carried my heavy suitcase down the stairs, I tripped on a step.\r\n\As soon as I tried to stand up, I could tell I had broken my foot.\r\n\
