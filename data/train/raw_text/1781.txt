Wildlife Encounter\r\n\We were driving home when we saw a mound of something in the street.\r\n\We looked carefully and saw that it was a big turtle!\r\n\We got out of the car and tried to lure it to the side of the road.\r\n\It suddenly leapt up and snapped at my husband's foot!\r\n\We love a turtle neighbor, but will be more careful next time!\r\n\
