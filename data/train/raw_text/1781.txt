Wildlife EncounterWe were driving home when we saw a mound of something in the street.We looked carefully and saw that it was a big turtle!We got out of the car and tried to lure it to the side of the road.It suddenly leapt up and snapped at my husband's foot!We love a turtle neighbor, but will be more careful next time!
