Dog\r\n\When my dog ran away, I thought I had lost him for good.\r\n\I had come home to find the gate open and my dog gone.\r\n\I called his name, searching high and low for him.\r\n\For two weeks, I talked to my neighbors, asking about my dog.\r\n\Only after I put up flyers did someone contact me to return my dog.\r\n\
