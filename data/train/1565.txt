Slow Delivery\r\n\I used Foodler to order takeout from an Italian restaurant.\r\n\The delivery was supposed to be within 45 minutes.\r\n\After 45 minutes I called resturant.\r\n\They claimed they told Foodler delivery would be ninety minutes.\r\n\I canceled the order and never used Foodler again.\r\n\
