Soda Machine\r\n\My wife and i were sitting on our building bench.\r\n\We talked about how the building used to have a soda machine.\r\n\I saw a teen center nearby and wondered if they had a machine.\r\n\My wife walked into the center to look around.\r\n\Sad to say, she could not find a soda machine.\r\n\
