Growing Grass\r\n\Once the new house was built, we knew we had to grow grass.\r\n\So we had it hydroseeded and then started to water it everyday.\r\n\However it didn't rain all summer long.\r\n\So every day we had to go turn the sprinkler on.\r\n\The grass eventually grew and so did our water bill.\r\n\
