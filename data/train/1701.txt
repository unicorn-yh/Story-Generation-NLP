It's hard to escape the sun\r\n\This week, there was a heat wave.\r\n\I was sitting next to a window in direct sunlight so I got overheated.\r\n\To cool off, I moved to a room on the other side of the house.\r\n\Unfortunately, I forgot that the sun moves.\r\n\All too soon, the sun was heating up the room I'd moved to instead.\r\n\
