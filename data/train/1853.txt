The Truck Driver\r\n\It was late at night and Dustin was driving his rig.\r\n\It was probably about 1 in the morning when he came around that curve.\r\n\Lying upside down in a ditch was a sedan.\r\n\He stopped, jumped out, and ran over to help.\r\n\If he hadn't been there that night the girl might have died.\r\n\
