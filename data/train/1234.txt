The New House\r\n\Moving has always been a struggle for me.\r\n\We moved into our new house across the country last year.\r\n\I just got a new job and am starting to enjoy my time.\r\n\After one of my shifts I came home and see firetrucks.\r\n\Panicking, I rush down my street and see my house on fire.\r\n\
