Golly Geez Dakota!\r\n\When I moved to South Dakota I needed to file documents for my LLC.\r\n\I gasped with surprise at the hefty fees!\r\n\They were fifteen times as much as they were in my previous state!\r\n\I thought long and hard about what I should do.\r\n\Eventually I decided to just dissolve my company.\r\n\
