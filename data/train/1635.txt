Writing stories\r\n\When I was younger I used to love to write stories.\r\n\My favorite story was one I had written about my dog.\r\n\In the story me and my dog went on adventures together.\r\n\I showed the story to all of my friends and they loved it.\r\n\I still really love writing stories and sharing them with others.\r\n\
