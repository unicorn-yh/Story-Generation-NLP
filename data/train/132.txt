My Shopping Trip\r\n\Yesterday, I went shopping for shoes.\r\n\I went to Shoe Carnival, looking for a great pair of running shoes.\r\n\I found all kinds of colorful options, and it was very hard to choose.\r\n\I picked a pair with rainbow colors, because it made me feel young.\r\n\I walked out of the store very happy with my purchase.\r\n\
