Skittles\r\n\I have a friend who fell in love with Skittles when we were five.\r\n\He ate them every day, and would bring them in a container to my house.\r\n\He liked the red ones the best, so he'd give me all the rest.\r\n\We sat on the bed and ate them and drank chocolate milk.\r\n\We did this every day after school for 3 years.\r\n\
