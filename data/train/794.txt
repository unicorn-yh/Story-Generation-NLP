My Pretty Pony\r\n\In 1983, I received a My Little Pony for Christmas.\r\n\I refused to open or play with any of my other gifts.\r\n\My family thought it was funny, because I told them I didn't want them.\r\n\I truly only wanted the large plastic horse.\r\n\I slept with it that night, and hit my brother in my sleep with it.\r\n\
