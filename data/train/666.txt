Remember the Mouse?\r\n\Charlie swept the floor happily.\r\n\He liked getting all the dirt off it and making it very clean.\r\n\Charlie's coworkers made him a special sticker to put on his chest.\r\n\It said he was a very special person who did a very special job.\r\n\It made Charlie want to sweep the floor even better!\r\n\
