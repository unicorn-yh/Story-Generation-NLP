Meeting Mickey\r\n\I went to Disney World for the first time when I was 7.\r\n\My parents bought me an book to collect character signatures.\r\n\I was so excited to get Mickey's signature so I didn't notice a line.\r\n\I ran to hug Mickey, cutting in front of many other kids.\r\n\The girl who was next in line yelled at me.\r\n\
