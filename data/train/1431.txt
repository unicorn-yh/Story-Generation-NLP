Sea Creature Experience\r\n\When visiting Hawaii, my husband asked me to snorkel with a manta ray.\r\n\I was a little scared, especially since the dive was at night!\r\n\We were all stretched out in the water, holding onto the float.\r\n\Our faces were in the water and bright lights were on.\r\n\Suddenly, a huge and graceful manta swam within inches of my face!\r\n\
