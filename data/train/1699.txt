Chain of bad Luck\r\n\Since the bus came late, I ended up late to my class.\r\n\Since my professor was in a bad mood, he yelled at me.\r\n\He also gave me a zero grade for today's assignments.\r\n\Later on that day, I found out that I dropped out of my classes.\r\n\Financial aid told me that there was nothing that I can do.\r\n\
