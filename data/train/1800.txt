Ran Into Him\r\n\As an American in Holland, there was only one thing to do.\r\n\I made my way to the red light district.\r\n\I was a bit embarrassed because as an American I had a closed mind.\r\n\I was pushing myself to be more open about it, though.\r\n\Suddenly I ran into Adrian Smith of the band Iron Maiden!\r\n\
