Dinosaur Party\r\n\When I was little, we lived on a street with a lot of other kids.\r\n\One of my closest friends was a little boy.\r\n\One year, he had a dinosaur themed party to which I wasn't invited.\r\n\I asked him why I couldn't come, since I liked dinosaurs too.\r\n\He told me I wasn't invited because I was a girl.\r\n\
