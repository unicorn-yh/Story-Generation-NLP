Tour of Brighton\r\n\I just finished reading Brighton, a murder mystery.\r\n\The novel featured a lot of local stores and landmarks.\r\n\I loved the novel, as I lived in Brighton for thirty years.\r\n\After I read the book I toured the area to see the locations.\r\n\Now I got excited by the news they might make a movie.\r\n\
