Close but Not Close\r\n\I stole the ball from my opponent and approached my side of the court.\r\n\I tried to run fast in order to stay ahead of the opposing team.\r\n\When I reached the free throw line, I attempted to do a slam dunk.\r\n\However, my head landed on the side of the backboard.\r\n\I instantly fell on my back and the medics had to take care of me.\r\n\
