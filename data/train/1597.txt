Tired Eyes\r\n\I was driving across the country to visit my in-laws.\r\n\It was a 48 hour drive if you only made stops for food and gas.\r\n\I was on hour 36 with no sleep.\r\n\The tree's started waving to me and the lines started getting blurry.\r\n\I had tired eyes and my mind was tricking me so I stopped and slept.\r\n\
