Secret Santa\r\n\My family decided to try something new for Christmas.\r\n\They decided we would draw names out of a hat and buy one gift.\r\n\I drew my crazy uncle Jim's name out of the hat.\r\n\The only thing I knew that he loved was the show Cops and beer.\r\n\So I bought him too much beer and he ended up on Cops season 27.\r\n\
