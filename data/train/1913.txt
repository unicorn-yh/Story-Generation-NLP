I Might Lose My Job\r\n\I recently started work at a medium-sized housing company.\r\n\I was instructed to send individual emails to tenants.\r\n\Wanting to speed things up, I sent a single email to all 450 tenants.\r\n\Apparently this is a severe violation of federal policy.\r\n\I could be in a lot of trouble if someone reports me.\r\n\
