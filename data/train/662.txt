Infinite Jest\r\n\I was reading Infinite Jest on the bench in Cambridge today.\r\n\My friends from the building came by and said hello.\r\n\They had a guest from Chicago who had read the book.\r\n\We had an interesting conversation about the book.\r\n\I gave him a map of the area, as the book's setting is nearby.\r\n\
