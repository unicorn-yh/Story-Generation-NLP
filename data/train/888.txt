Opening Day\r\n\On April 11, the Boston Red Sox had their home opener.\r\n\Our apartment building sponsored a party in the clubroom.\r\n\They served popcorn and soda, and had the game on a big screen tv.\r\n\Residents were urged to wear Red Sox gear and enter a raffle.\r\n\I wore a Koji Uehara shirt and won two tickets in the raffle.\r\n\
