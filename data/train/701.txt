Ask For It\r\n\One day we saw some teenagers on our trampoline.\r\n\We did not invite them, and went to ask what they were doing.\r\n\We told them we would be happy to let them jump if they had asked.\r\n\They responded with attitude and did not want to get off.\r\n\We jumped with them, trying to show kindness anyways.\r\n\
