Going to a Concert\r\n\One of my favorite bands came to my city.\r\n\I made sure to buy tickets to see them ahead of time.\r\n\I waited in line for an hour before I got in the venue.\r\n\While they played, I yelled until I nearly hoarse.\r\n\I was completely exhausted when I got home that night.\r\n\
