Frank's Birthday\r\n\On June 13th, my wife and I visited Sara and her son Frank.\r\n\We live down the hall from each other in a high rise in Cambridge.\r\n\Frank was turning five, and we brought over a present.\r\n\He is a Star Wars fan, so we bought him a Lego set featuring R2D2.\r\n\He was very happy to get the present, and spent an hour building it.\r\n\
