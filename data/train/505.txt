University of Alabama\r\n\My niece's daughter was accepted into the University of Alabama.\r\n\She was thrilled to go, and wanted to accept.\r\n\Her mother noted the financial aid was only for $130,000 of loans.\r\n\She had two other kids and could not afford to take out the loans.\r\n\Her daughter reluctantly went to a nearby state school.\r\n\
