Scary Movies\r\n\My friend Jim invited me to see a scary movie the other day.\r\n\I don't like scary movies at all, but I told him I would go anyways.\r\n\We went to the theater and bought popcorn and drinks.\r\n\When the movie started I was nervous that it would be too scary.\r\n\Fortunately, the movie wasn't that scary and we had a good time.\r\n\
