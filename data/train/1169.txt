Moving\r\n\When I was 5, my dad accepted a new job in Cleveland.\r\n\We lived in Dallas at the time, so we had to move far away.\r\n\We were worried about leaving all of our friends and family.\r\n\When we moved, we found that everyone was very nice.\r\n\We had no reason to worry, because we made a lot of new friends.\r\n\
