Concert with Dad\r\n\When I was 14, my favorite band came to town for a concert.\r\n\My dad bought tickets under the condition that he could chaperone.\r\n\At the concert, he stayed in the balcony while I was in the mosh pit.\r\n\Afterwards, he said he hated the music.\r\n\A week later, I found him listening to the band's music.\r\n\
