Bird Opening\r\n\I like to play 3 minute speed chess online.\r\n\Sometimes this lets me beat better players by speed.\r\n\I recently practiced an obscure opening, the Bird.\r\n\It is not well known, and makes the opponent take time.\r\n\So far I have beaten two players who ar 300 points better.\r\n\
