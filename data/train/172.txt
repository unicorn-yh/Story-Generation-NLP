Finally Tall Enough\r\n\Billy wasn't able to ride the big roller coaster last year.\r\n\He didn't meet the height requirement.\r\n\He knew he had grown in the past year.\r\n\He ran up to the measuring stick to see if he was finally tall enough.\r\n\He made it by over an inch so he could finally get on it!\r\n\
