Rainy Day Kitties\r\n\The cats were yowling at the door to be let out.\r\n\When the door opened and they saw the rain, they stopped dead.\r\n\They looked out at the rain falling in apparent disgust.\r\n\They quickly backed away from the door and the rain.\r\n\Curling up in a ball, they slept until the rain ended.\r\n\
