Salty People\r\n\I walked on campus and noticed a friend who I didn't see in a while.\r\n\I tried to approach her in a friendly manner and say hi.\r\n\When she saw her, she had a bad grin on her face.\r\n\She remembers me however, she rushed our conversation.\r\n\Afterwards, she quickly walked away.\r\n\
