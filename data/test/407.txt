Sleeping Problems\r\n\Last night, I didn't go to sleep until 1 AM.\r\n\At 4 AM, my cat woke me up by biting my toes.\r\n\I was very annoyed with him because I had to wake up at 5.\r\n\I went to a different room where he couldn't enter.\r\n\I slept blissfully until my alarm went off an hour later.\r\n\
