Dinner with coworkers\r\n\On May 18th, my wife and I had dinner with 3 of my former coworkers.\r\n\I am retired but still stay in touch.\r\n\We met at Salvatore's, an Italian restaurant in downtown Boston.\r\n\We had no reservations and had to sit at the bar.\r\n\We had a great time catching up, and vowed to meet soon.\r\n\
