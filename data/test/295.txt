Water\r\n\Determined to drink more water, I carried a water bottle everywhere.\r\n\One thing that I have omitted is making the sure the bottle is closed.\r\n\One time, I put the bottle of water in my bag with the cap off.\r\n\I soon discovered the water had soaked my books completely.\r\n\Fortunately, my books were still readable after that event.\r\n\
