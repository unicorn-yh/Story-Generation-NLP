Theo's Fear of Heights\r\n\Theo was a very nervous child with a long-time fear of heights.\r\n\One hot summer day, his friends invited him to a water park.\r\n\His crush, Lucy, was there and she loved slides, so Theo had an idea.\r\n\Theo asked her to join him on a two-person toboggan, and she accepted!\r\n\Together, they rode the slide, with Theo screaming, but happy as ever!\r\n\
