Door Handle Disaster!Yesterday I received a huge box of door handles I had ordered.I opened it to reveal beautiful, shiny new handles.I carefully removed the old, ugly handles from my doors.The new latches and striker plates do not fit the openings on the doors!I must fix the new parts so that the doors close properly.
