Scrabble Friends\r\n\Yesterday I went to a friend's house to play Scrabble.\r\n\We have been Scrabble buddies for many years.\r\n\We played three games, and the competition was fierce.\r\n\My friend won two games and I was very disappointed.\r\n\Luckily, my friend made a peach pie and offered it as consolation!\r\n\
