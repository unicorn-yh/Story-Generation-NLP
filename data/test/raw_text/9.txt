Charlie Horse\r\n\I got Charlie Horse when I was four years old.\r\n\He's a brown stuffed horse, and at 35 I still sleep with him at night.\r\n\He was my best friend, and always laid at the head of my bed.\r\n\I laid him next to me, smelling his soft fur every night.\r\n\I liked to listen to my radio as I fell asleep cuddling him.\r\n\
