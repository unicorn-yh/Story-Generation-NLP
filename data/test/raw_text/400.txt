Mountain climbing\r\n\A few years back, my brother went mountain climbing in Utah.\r\n\He climbed a very tall structure over many hours.\r\n\When he arrived on top, he realized he had no more water.\r\n\He had to climb down while being very thirsty.\r\n\The first thing he did when he reached town was to drink water.\r\n\
