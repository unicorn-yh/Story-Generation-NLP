6 Week Course\r\n\I entered my Biochemistry class with confidence during the first day.\r\n\Since I spent hours studying, I had no doubt that I would fail.\r\n\However, I ended up failing my first two tests.\r\n\Although there was no way of passing the class, I still tried.\r\n\I ended up failing and took this experience as a learning one.\r\n\
