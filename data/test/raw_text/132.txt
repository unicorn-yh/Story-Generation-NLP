My Shopping TripYesterday, I went shopping for shoes.I went to Shoe Carnival, looking for a great pair of running shoes.I found all kinds of colorful options, and it was very hard to choose.I picked a pair with rainbow colors, because it made me feel young.I walked out of the store very happy with my purchase.
