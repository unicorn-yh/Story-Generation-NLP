Too Bad\r\n\I was listening to the music saved on my phone.\r\n\Since the volume was on the highest setting, I couldn't hear anything.\r\n\My mom tried to call me, but I didn't respond since I didn't hear her.\r\n\When I went to look for my leftover food, it was gone.\r\n\My mom told me that she ate it.\r\n\
