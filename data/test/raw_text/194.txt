Hamburger\r\n\It was my first time cooking dinner for myself.\r\n\I decided to stay simple and cooked a hamburger.\r\n\As the meat cooked, my nose was treated with a wondrous smell.\r\n\After it finished, I took it off the grill and slapped it on a bun.\r\n\I wasted no time and took a huge bite of my perfect burger.\r\n\
