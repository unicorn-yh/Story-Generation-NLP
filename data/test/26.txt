My Diagnosis\r\n\When I was 12 years old, my dad got angry and kicked me aggressively.\r\n\Afterward, I became very ill, and tasted something metallic.\r\n\I went to a doctor, and was informed that one of my kidneys was dead.\r\n\Ever since, I've had swelling and hypertension.\r\n\I started taking medications to combat the symptoms at 13.\r\n\
