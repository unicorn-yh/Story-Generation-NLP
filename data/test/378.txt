Worry about Mexico\r\n\I was very worried about studying abroad in Mexico.\r\n\I spoke very good Spanish, but I wasn't sure if it would be enough.\r\n\I was nervous the entire plane ride to Mexico City.\r\n\When I got there, my host family greeted me with open arms.\r\n\They told me not to worry because I spoke great Spanish.\r\n\
