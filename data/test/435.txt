Turkey Replacement\r\n\Bev had baked a lovely turkey for her family's Thanksgiving dinner.\r\n\Everyone was at the table waiting.\r\n\She went into the kitchen to take the turkey into the dining room.\r\n\Just as she turned the corner she saw her big dog running off with it.\r\n\After she got it away from him, she made hamburgers for her family.\r\n\
